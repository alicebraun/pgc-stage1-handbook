Occasionally researchers will request summary statistics **excluding specific samples**. <br>
A number of readily available files is stored in figshare on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/scz2022/19426775).<br>

Files in figshare are the initial release of summary statistics from the wave 3 meta-analysis GWAS of
schizophrenia in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The analysis details are
described in the Nature publication entitled “Mapping genomic loci implicates genes and
synaptic biology in schizophrenia” and found at the following DOI:
[https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5).

The core meta-analysis consists of cohorts primarily of east asian and
european ancestry. The primary includes the core cohorts, and additionally summary
statistics from cohorts of african american and latino ancestry.

Summary statistics are available for the following subsets:
