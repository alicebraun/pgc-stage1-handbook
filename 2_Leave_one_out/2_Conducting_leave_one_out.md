# Conducting leave-one-out analyses

In order to conduct LNO analyses on SURFsnellius we need to navigate to the following working directories: <br>
`/gpfs/work5/0/pgcdac/DWFV2CJb8Piv_0116_pgc_data/pgcdrc/scz/working/wave3/summary_stats/`
It contains several sub-directories: <br>


>  .../summary_stats/ <br>

&emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp;  &emsp; &ensp;| PRS  <br>

The automsomes directory contains several filtered subsets of the individual 90 cohorts: <br>
`cd /gpfs/work5/0/pgcdac/DWFV2CJb8Piv_0116_pgc_data/pgcdrc/scz/working/wave3/summary_stats/autosomes/single/assoc_single`
In order to run a LNO analyses we take the table generated by the requesting researcher in 1_Leave-one-out_requests and take the <mark>PRS_results_file_name</mark> column to generate a results file.<br>
To run the LNO analyses using RICOPILI you run the follwing command from within the directory with the relevant subset (all, male_all etc.):<br>
`postimp_navi --out daner_NAME --result results_FILE --addout NAME --noldsc`
